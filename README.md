Managing a library is a very difficult task as we need to keep track of lots of things, we need to keep track of all books, how many copies there are and we also need to keep track whether they are available for students to borrow or not.

In this article, we will build a basic library management system in Java using switch statement. In this project, we will add various functionality such as adding new books, searching for books, and registering students.

Why Build this Library Management System?

While learning Java, exploring how to design and manage small applications makes our concepts more strong, with the help of this project we will understand the working of lots of things which are listed below:

  We get to know how to use switch statements for menu-driven applications
  We get to know how to manage data with classes and objects.
  We get to know how to implement core features like search, add, and update in a real-world scenario.


  Features of the Project :
  
The library management system will support the following operations which are listed below:

    Exit Application
    Add a New Book
    Upgrade Quantity of a Book
    Search a Book
    Show All Books
    Register Student
    Show All Registered Students
    Check Out Book
    Check-In Book


    Project Structure
Our mini-project will be split into five Java files and each will handle a specific part of the system. The table below demonstrates the file name with their responsibilty.

  File names                                                              Responsibilty
  Library.java             ->                         This is the main application with the menu and execution flow.
  book.java                ->                         This file represent individual book detail.
  books.java               ->                         This file manages the collection of books and related operations.
  books.java               ->                         This file manages the collection of books and related operations.
  student.java             ->                         This file represents individual student details.
  students.java            ->                         This file manages student records and book borrowing



Note: As per naming conventions in Java, it is good practice to have class initial with uppercase letter still here we are adhering with lowercase for better understanding of the code.
Before we get into more details, let's first try to understand how the system is put together. 
As we already know each class is our project has its own work and all these files will work together to make the library management system work more smoothly. 
We are using different files because we do not want to make the code more complex, by keeping all the files seprate we are increasing the readability of the code.
